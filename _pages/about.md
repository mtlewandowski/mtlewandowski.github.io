I conduct research on decision-making under risk, ambiguity, time delays, and strategic uncertainty. I am currently working as a PI in the OPUS research grant of the Polish National Science Center, measuring and characterizing attitudes toward uncertainty using indifference prices. 

My research can be accesses via my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c4VTqNsAAAAJ&hl=pl&oi=sra), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michal-Lewandowski-4) or [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6003-1859) profiles. 

I am currenty working on several projects. Preliminary drafts are available below

[Biseparable representations of the certainty equivalents](files/Biseparablerepresentations.pdf)

joint work with [Jacek Chudziak](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacek-Chudziak)

**Abstract:** We consider the following biseparable representation of the certainty equivalent:
$F(x, y; p) = u^{−1}(w(p)u(x) + (1 − w(p))u(y))$, where $(x, y; p)$ is the binary monetary
prospect, u is the utility function, and w is the probability weighting function. We
provide a simple set of axioms characterizing this form for all binary prospects as well
as for the subset of binary prospects, called simple prospects, in which one of the two
payoffs is fixed. We consider both the case of general w and the case of expected utility,
where w is the identity function. We discuss the extent to which such models can be
identified, the issue of extending these models to a larger number of payoffs, and draw
conclusions for model testing.

[Preference imprecision or uncertainty aversion - decomposing WTA and WTP gap for uncertain prospects](files/Preferenceimprecision.pdf)

joint work with [Łukasz Woźny](https://lwozny.github.io/) and [Michał Jakubczyk](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=nDKUkZMAAAAJ&hl=pl)

**Abstract:** We propose a setup to account for two leading explanations of the WTA-WTP disparity:
one based on the loss aversion and the other based on preference imprecision. We propose two
axioms that allows us to distinguish the part of WTA-WTP disparity atributed to each of these
two explanations. Our approach is general and incorporates some of the leading models as
special cases. To illustrate our approach we propose a simple experiment that allows to quantitatively
decompose the WTA-WTP gap in the two analyzed channels.

[Individual and collective rationality in carpooling](files/Carpoolinggame.pdf)

joint work with [Pawel Kalczynki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RfvpViEAAAAJ&hl=en)

**Abstract:** We define carpooling as a coalition game and present a socially optimal solution that
minimizes the overall cost of commuting and is stable and fair. Instead of transferring
costs between players, individual rationality is achieved by appropriate composition
and assignment of drivers within carpools. We develop a three-step solution procedure,
where our final solution is based on the stable pre-nucleolus of the underlying game. The
results of computational experiments show that our procedure guarantees substantial
gains from carpooling. These gains increase with the number of commuters and are
comparable to gains achieved by centralized systems, which ignore stability and fairness.

[Analiza krytyczna metody weryfikacji wyników wyborów
przedstawionej w (Kontek K., Weryfikacja wyniku drugiej tury
wyborów prezydenckich w Polsce w 2025 roku: Przeliczenie głosów
z użyciem przestrzennie grupowanej metody MAD)](files/Manipulacje_Kontka.pdf)

joint work with Mariusz Kozakiewicz, Bogusz Lewandowski, Pawel Kalczynski

**Abstract:** This paper presents a methodological and substantive critique of (Kontek K., 2025, Reassessing poland’s 2024 presidential runoff: Using spatially-grouped mad
detection to recalculate the result. available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5296435.),
which analyzes the impact of anomalies on the second round of Polish presidential election outcomes
in 2025. We identify a key flaw: anomalies are detected only when favoring one candidate,
with reverse cases omitted. First, we replicate the original results. Second, using the same method,
we include reverse anomalies, showing how selective the original approach was. Third, we
question the validity of the methodology and the conclusions drawn. We argue that the findings
in the original study are methodologically biased and therefore unjustified.
Keywords: outlier detection, robust statistics, election manipulations
