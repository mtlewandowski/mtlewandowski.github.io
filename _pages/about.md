I conduct research on decision-making under risk, ambiguity, time delays, and strategic uncertainty. I am currently working as a PI in the OPUS research grant of the Polish National Science Center, measuring and characterizing attitudes toward uncertainty using indifference prices. 

My research can be accesses via my Google Scholar, ResearchGate or ORCID profiles linked on the left.
I am currenty working on several papers in a draft form:


[Biseparable representations of the certainty equivalents](files/Biseparable representations of CE.pdf)
We consider the following biseparable representation of the certainty equivalent:
$F(x, y; p) = u−1(w(p)u(x) + (1 − w(p))u(y))$, where $(x, y; p)$ is the binary monetary
prospect, u is the utility function, and w is the probability weighting function. We
provide a simple set of axioms characterizing this form for all binary prospects as well
as for the subset of binary prospects, called simple prospects, in which one of the two
payoffs is fixed. We consider both the case of general w and the case of expected utility,
where w is the identity function. We discuss the extent to which such models can be
identified, the issue of extending these models to a larger number of payoffs, and draw
conclusions for model testing.
