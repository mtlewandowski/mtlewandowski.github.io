I conduct research on decision-making under risk, ambiguity, time delays, and strategic uncertainty. I am currently working as a PI in the OPUS research grant of the Polish National Science Center, measuring and characterizing attitudes toward uncertainty using indifference prices. 

My research can be accesses via my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c4VTqNsAAAAJ&hl=pl&oi=sra), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michal-Lewandowski-4) or [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6003-1859) profiles. 

I am currenty working on several projects. Preliminary drafts are available in [Current research](/Research/)
