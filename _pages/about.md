I conduct research on decision-making under risk, ambiguity, time delays, and strategic uncertainty. I am currently working as a PI in the OPUS research grant of the Polish National Science Center, measuring and characterizing attitudes toward uncertainty using indifference prices. 

My research can be accesses via my Google Scholar, ResearchGate or ORCID profiles linked on the left.
I am currenty working on several papers in a draft form:


[Biseparable representations of the certainty equivalents](files/Biseparable representations of CE.pdf)
[Preference imprecision or uncertainty aversion - decomposing WTA and WTP gap for uncertain prospects](files/Preference imprecision or uncertainty aversion decomposing WTA and WTP gap for uncertain prospects.pdf)
[Discounted Incremental Utility](files/Discounted incremenetal Utility.pdf)
[Individual and collective rationality in carpooling](files/Carpooling game.pdf)
