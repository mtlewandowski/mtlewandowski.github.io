I am currenty working on several papers. Preliminary drafts are available below:

[Biseparable representations of the certainty equivalents](files/Biseparable representations of CE.pdf)

joint work with [Jacek Chudziak](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacek-Chudziak)

**Abstract:** We consider the following biseparable representation of the certainty equivalent:
$F(x, y; p) = u^{−1}(w(p)u(x) + (1 − w(p))u(y))$, where $(x, y; p)$ is the binary monetary
prospect, u is the utility function, and w is the probability weighting function. We
provide a simple set of axioms characterizing this form for all binary prospects as well
as for the subset of binary prospects, called simple prospects, in which one of the two
payoffs is fixed. We consider both the case of general w and the case of expected utility,
where w is the identity function. We discuss the extent to which such models can be
identified, the issue of extending these models to a larger number of payoffs, and draw
conclusions for model testing.

[Preference imprecision or uncertainty aversion - decomposing WTA and WTP gap for uncertain prospects](files/Preference imprecision or uncertainty aversion decomposing WTA and WTP gap for uncertain prospects.pdf)

joint work with [Łukasz Woźny](https://lwozny.github.io/) and [Michał Jakubczyk](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=nDKUkZMAAAAJ&hl=pl)

**Abstract:** We propose a setup to account for two leading explanations of the WTA-WTP disparity:
one based on the loss aversion and the other based on preference imprecision. We propose two
axioms that allows us to distinguish the part of WTA-WTP disparity atributed to each of these
two explanations. Our approach is general and incorporates some of the leading models as
special cases. To illustrate our approach we propose a simple experiment that allows to quantitatively
decompose the WTA-WTP gap in the two analyzed channels.

[Discounted Incremental Utility](files/Discounted incremenetal Utility.pdf)

joint work with [Manel Baucells](https://www.manelbaucells.com/)

**Abstract:** Most decisions involve multiple payoffs over time and under risk, as for instance the sequential
play of a lottery. For an individual who cares not only about profit at the end, but
also on how early these profits accrue, we apply a modified version of the axioms of subjective
expected utility to obtain the Discounted Incremental Utility model. 

[Individual and collective rationality in carpooling](files/Carpooling game.pdf)

joint work with [Pawel Kalczynki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RfvpViEAAAAJ&hl=en)

**Abstract:** We define carpooling as a coalition game and present a socially optimal solution that
minimizes the overall cost of commuting and is stable and fair. Instead of transferring
costs between players, individual rationality is achieved by appropriate composition
and assignment of drivers within carpools. We develop a three-step solution procedure,
where our final solution is based on the stable pre-nucleolus of the underlying game. The
results of computational experiments show that our procedure guarantees substantial
gains from carpooling. These gains increase with the number of commuters and are
comparable to gains achieved by centralized systems, which ignore stability and fairness.
