utility theory with gambling wealth"

excerpt: 'I analyze two expected utility models which abandon the consequentialist
assumption of terminal wealth positions. In the expected utility of gambling wealth
model, in which initial wealth is allowed to be small, I show that a large WTA/WTP
gap is possible and the (Rabin in Econometrica, 68(5), 1281â€“1292, 2000) paradox
may be resolved. Within the same model the classical preference reversal which
allows arbitrage is not possible, whereas preference reversal (involving buying prices
in place of selling prices), which does not allow arbitrage, is possible. In the expected
utility of wealth changes model, in which there is no initial wealth, I show that both
a WTA/WTP gap as well as the classical preference reversal are possible due to loss
aversion, both in its general as well as some specific forms.'
