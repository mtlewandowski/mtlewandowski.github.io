First, this paper introduces and axiomatizes range-dependent utility as a new conceptual framework for decision-making under risk. It is a simple and well-defined generalization of Expected Utility Theory in which utility depends on the range of lottery outcomes. Second, a special case of this framework is proposed for prediction. It is based on applying a single utility function (decision utility) to every normalized lottery range. The resulting decision utility model predicts well-known Expected Utility paradoxes without recourse to probability weighting. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the model to satisfy monotonicity with respect to FOSD are identified. The typical decision utility function is S-shaped which is confirmed both by experimental data and normative considerations.
